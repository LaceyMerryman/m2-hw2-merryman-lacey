        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Being from California, originally, I am inclined to explore and enjoy the great outdoors. Hiking, diving, running, cycling and swimming are some of my hobbies, to name a few. If ever an adventure to explore outside arises, I am up for it. I recently moved from Monterey, CA to Oahu, HI and being surrounded by the ocean and incredible mountains, I am eager to be immersed in these areas as well. My other hobbies include showing my dog the world around him.</p>
